Polyclass is a _just-in-time_ CSS class library, built dynamically from your class-names using "Declarative CSS".

</div>


> All the boilerplate CSS is builtin with Polyclass.js


This open-source, lightweight library is tailored for dynamic CSS management, generating a graph of keys for all CSS properties. With the capability to boilerplate millions of unique class combinations through declarative naming, Polyclass offers eliminating the need for in-line styles. Whether you're working with pre-rendered content or making live DOM changes, Polyclass ensures the stylesheet is declared as needed.

+ Readable
+ Instantly plug-and-play
+ No Dependencies, and works along-side all the major libraries.

## Ina Hurry?

Include:

```jinja
<script src="polyclass.js"></script>
```

Polyclass automatic:

```jinja
<body polyclass> <!-- Activate -->
  <h1
    class='color-#999'> <!-- Write classes -->
    Grey Title!</h1>
</body>
```

**Polyclass anything!**

```jinja
<div class="my-container some-other-primary-area
    font-pack-roboto-100-400-i400
    background-#333">

      <div class="demo-box
        gap-1em
        display-flex
        flex-direction-column">

          <div class="text
            background-color-#111
            border-solid-3px-green
            border-radius-.4em
            padding-.8em-1.4em
            color-#EEE
            font-roboto-400
            margin-1em">

              Text content.
          </div>
      </div>
</div>
```

## Bits and Bolts:

+ [Run](./running-polyclass.md)
+ [`font-pack-*` addon](./font-pack.md): Install and use fonts dynamically with `font-pack-*`
+ [CSS `var()`](./css-var.md): Utilise variables for declarative properties and values `color-var-primary-text`
+ [Polyclass `vars()` object](./vars-object.md): Use Javascript objects as CSS `--var` definitions.
+ [`vendor-*` prefix](./vendor-prefix.md): Scope Polyclass usage to a prefix such as `acme-company-background-black`
+ [Aliases](./aliases.md): Reduce typing by aliasing long words `background` => `bg` == `bg-color-*`
+ [Inserting Rules](./inserting-rules.md): Inject CSS declarations and custom class detection functions.
+ [Polyclass and CSS Anatomy](./anatomy.md): Understand a CSS Property
+ [Addons](./addons.md): Read more on the addon platform for customising Polyclass internals

## Usage

Include Polyclass as a script:

```jinja
<script src="polyclass.js"></script>
```

Use the Polyclass automatic detection:

```jinja
<body polyclass>
  <h1 class='color-#999'>Grey Title!</h1>
</body>
```

Or run `Polyclass` somewhere in your code. It can run in the `<head>` or `<footer>` of a page:

```js
const pc = Polyclass({
  processOnLoad: document.body
})
```

If the page is already loaded, run the `process()` method:

```js
const pc = Polyclass()
pc.process(document.body)
```

And you're ready to go! Populate the html classes to see it in action:

```jinja
<div id="demo_space"
    class='foo
           padding-1em-2em
           margin-1em
           color-#333'>
    <p>Styled content from <strong>only</strong> CSS classes.</p>
</div>
```

The styles are automatically generated:

| class | description |
| --- | --- |
| `padding-1em-2em` | Padding, top and bottom `1em`, left and right `2em` |
| `margin-1em` | Margin, all sides `1em` |
| `color-#333`| Text color, nearly black `#333` |


Here's the CSS Polyclass created:

```css
.padding-1em-2em {
    padding: 1em 2em;
}

.margin-1em {
    margin: 1em;
}

.color-#333 {
    color: #333;
}
```

## Who is this for?


### Designers

Iterate on your styles until you're happy. With a **massive** base of rules there is less to _build_ as you invent.


### Developers

Don't spend time caring for your _base styles_. Use a declarative naming convension for your class names for easy to document, easy to integrate core styles, and less bytes to download.



### Vendors

Build your layout engine or style library. Enable the _vendor_ prefix and invent your own dynamic classes.


## Why?


+ **Reduce Boilerplate**
  Ideas change. Designs alter. Polyclass can help kill the junk CSS and massive boiler-sheets of _pre defined classes_.

+ **Become your own vendor!**
  Don't settle for a _forever_ locked-in eco-system, supporting enourmous stylesheets. Build out your own boilerplate, add a vendor switch and job done!

+ **Generate _Dynamic Classes_**
  Build dyanamic names to write base and generate layouts without limits, such as a column-stucture: `acme-grid-columms-4`,  `acme-grid-columms-3`, `acme-grid-columms-12`

+ **Faster page load times**
  CSS mean bytes down the pipe. Polyclass builds CSS on the fly.

+ **Dynamic CSS tooling**
  With _ALL CSS_ Properties ready to go, you can offer this tool in your buildouts; for dynamic styling of your components - without base sheets and limits.

  + CMS theming addons
  + HTML edit only environments
  + extend to make your own dynamic sheet inclusions.

## Example

If there is a CSS Property, it can be defined in Polyclass.


Here's some HTML, with some `Polyclass` CSS `class` attributes:

```jinja
<div class="my-container some-other-primary-area
    font-pack-roboto-100-400-i400
    background-#333">
      <div class="demo-box
        gap-1em
        display-flex
        flex-direction-column
        ">
          <div class="text
            background-color-#111
            border-solid-3px-green
            border-radius-.4em
            padding-.8em-1.4em
            color-#EEE
            font-roboto-400
            margin-1em">
              Text content.
          </div>
      </div>
</div>
```

Once defined, the constructed classes are invented:

    background-color-#111
    background-#333
    border-solid-3px-green
    border-radius-.4em
    color-#EEE
    display-flex
    flex-direction-column
    gap-1em
    margin-1em
    padding-.8em-1.4em

    font-pack-roboto-100-400-i400
    font-roboto-400

As expected each class exactly represents the `key:value` of any _declarable_ CSS Property.


Without using any existing CSS sheets, Polyclass will generate all the expected CSS as a contructed stylesheet.


## Features

+ Comprehensive Graph: A detailed graph of CSS attributes, ensuring you have access to every possible style combination.
+ Dynamic Class Combinations: Generate over a million unique class combinations with both short and long flavors for each CSS declaration.
+ Real-time: Seamless compatibility with both pre-rendered content and live DOM changes.


## Getting Started

To get started with Polyclass, follow these steps:

TLDR;

1. Include the library
2. Write class names

```jinja
<div class='margin-1em'></div>
<div class='margin-4vw-1.5ch'></div>
<div class='margin-1.453em-53px'></div>
<div class='padding-var-very-wide'></div>
```

---

1. Include the Main Script:

  Add the `polyclass.js` script to your HTML file.

      <script src="path_to_your_directory/polyclass.min.js"></script>

2. Define through JS or HTML attibute:

  Using the HTML attribute:

  ```jinja
  <body polyclass></body>
  ```

  Using the Javascript instance:

  ```js
  const pc = Polyclass({
      , processOnLoad: document.body
  })
  ```

3. Write Your Declarative CSS:

  In your HTML, you can now start using the declarative CSS syntax provided by the library. For example:

      <div class="my-label
                padding-1em
                margin-.4em-1em
                background-#333
                color-white"
            >Hello World!</div>


## Current Class Count

Current class count is still increasing; Not including the `font-pack` addon.

There are roughly 139 top level attributes (`margin`, `border` etc..)

+ Every sub attribute is a key (about 209 in total)
+ Every size type,
  + absolute (about 7; `cm`, `px`, `Q` etc..)
  + relative (about 20, `em`, `vw` `svh` etc)
+ Every color (16M hex short and long formats, all the websafe colours)


## Info

For more advanced usage, you can explore the various modules and functionalities provided by the library:

+ Font Pack Add-on: Enhance your typography with the `font-pack.js` add-on. This allows you to easily integrate various font styles and weights into your project.
+ Monitor Add-on: With the `monitor.js` add-on, you can keep track of changes and updates to your declarative CSS in real-time.
+ Class Graph: The `classgraph.js` module provides a way to visualize and understand the relationships between different CSS classes in your project.
+ Core DCSS: The core functionality of the library can be found in `dcss.js`. This is where the magic happens, allowing you to write declarative CSS with ease.


## Usage

Once Polyclass is installed, it's ready to go. By default no configuration is required.

As a recap to installing:

  <script src="path_to_your_directory/polyclass.min.js"></script>

Then write some CSS classes to style:

```jinja
<div class="margin-1rem">
This has a margin of 1 real EM.
</div>
```

The CSS class `margin-1rem` will instantly generate into the dynamic stylesheet:

```css
.margin-1em {
  margin: 1rem
}
```

This works with essentially any class attribute:

```jinja
<body class='background-#111'>
  <div class="border-top-solid-1px border-radius-.4em color-green">
    This has a border with round edges.
  </div>
</body>
```
