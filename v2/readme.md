# Pipes (v2a)

The first version works very well and proves the ability to generate live SVG's and pen lines.

This version is a refactor of the original, with tools to simplify pen drawing - for better lines.

## Improvements

+ Lines should be easier to manipulate - single entities in a clear stack
+ Trackers should be easier to add and remove
+ rewrite the 'pipe' drawing
