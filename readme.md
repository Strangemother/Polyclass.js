### Your Instant, Pluggable, Dynamic CSS Base Library

Polyclass is a [_just-in-time_](#what-is-just-in-time) CSS class library, built dynamically from your class-names using "[Declarative CSS](#what-is-declarative-css)".

+ **Just-in-Time** runtime to declare CSS on-the-fly
+ **No opinion** no factory, forced, or predefined CSS included!
+ Supports **any** CSS length you need, from `px` to `cqmax`
+ **All** CSS Properties are ready, even: `order-block-start-style-dotted`!
+ **Less than 7 Kilobytes** (gzipped) including all addons.
+ over 5 quadrillion available properties *\*([and counting](./docs/class-count.md))* ðŸ˜…
+ No compilation, installation, dependencies, or IDE configurations!

```jinja
<head>
  <script type="text/javascript" src='polyclass.full.js'></script>
</head>

<body polyclass
  class="margin-0
         padding-0
         background-color-#111
         font-roboto
         font-pack-roboto-100-400-i400-800-900
         color-#DDD
         display-grid
         grid-template-flow-columns">

      <h1 class"font-size-5rem">ET VOILÃ€! Polyclassed.</h1>
</body
```

## Features

It's open-source, lightweight and runtime pluggable. With only HTML class names, immediately generate CSS declarations in a dynamic stylesheet:

+ Real-time or pre-render compatible
+ Instant plug-and-play with no compilation required
+ No dependencies, pure JavaScript
+ MIT License


### Invisible

Consider Polyclass as the missing link for `class` attribute  your CSS stylesheet.

+ The `style` attribute works as expected
+ Existing classes and libraries remain unaffected
+ Override Polyclass declarations without complex selectors
+ Works along-side any JavaScript library

It's an instant CSS base - use the classical CSS for your seriously cool stuff.

### Don't Tree-Shake! Tree Build!

Whether you're working with pre-rendered content or making live DOM changes, Polyclass ensures the stylesheet is declared as needed. No compilation steps or tree-shaking required, as Polyclass detects usage through a runtime tree immediately.

```jinja
<header polyclass
    class='display-flex
           position-sticky
           top-1em'>
    Flexy sticky header! No mess!
</header>
```

``` js
Polyclass.getInstance(header).asString()
// Rendered CSS Stylesheet.
```

Polyclass possibilities are loaded from the processed HTML entity, ensuring the library is always ever-green, naturally adopting CSS engine changes as soon as they exist, such as [Use Logical Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_logical_properties_and_values)

```jinja
<h2 class='scroll-margin-top-var-header-height text-wrap-balance'>
  Text balanced h2,
  With a scrolling margin,
  for the page header from the CSS Var "header-height"
</h2>
```

# Install &amp; Use

Polyclass is designed to be quick to initiate.

[Grab from jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/polyclass) and apply it directly to your HTML:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/polyclass@latest/dist/polyclass.full.js"></script>
```

[Grab from NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polyclass) and do node things:

```bash
npm install polyclass
```

An ESM import:

```js
import Polyclass from "polyclass"

new Polyclass()
```

`import()` on the `node` terminal:

```js
// Fetch the esm node default using import()
const { default: Polyclass } = await import("polyclass")

new Polyclass()
```

`require()` on the terminal:

```js
// Collect a .cjs module with require()
const polyclass = await require("polyclass")

new polyclass.Polyclass()
```


Or if you have the source-code locally:

```jinja
<!-- All included -->
<script src="polyclass/dist/polyclass.full.js"></script>

<script type="text/javascript">
    new Polyclass()
</script>
```


## Load

To load Polyclass use the automatic attribute `polyclass`, or create a new JavaScript instance `Polyclass()`. Multiple instances of Polyclass can exist in one view

---

### HTML `polyclass` attribute

Use the Polyclass automatic detection:

```jinja
<!-- previously installed -->
<body polyclass>
  <h1 class='color-#999'>Grey Title!</h1>
</body>
```

Read more in [Running Polyclass: Auto](./docs/running-polyclass.md#auto-polyclass)

---

### JavaScipt `Polyclass` Instance

Run `Polyclass` somewhere in your code. It can run in the `<head>`, the `<footer>`, or installed asynchronously.

```js
// Run when the DOM is prepared
const pc = Polyclass({
  processOnLoad: document.body
})
```

If the page is already loaded, run the `process()` method:

```js
// DOM Loaded
const pc = Polyclass()
pc.process(document.body) // detect after load

// or provide a `target` to process immediately:
const pc = Polyclass({ target: document.body })
```

Processing isn't required when using the `<Node polyclass></Node>` attribute. Read more in [Running Polyclass: Instance](./docs/running-polyclass.md#polyclass-instance)

---

## Using Classes

Once installed, populate the html classes to see it in action:

```jinja
<!-- previously imported polyclass -->
<div id="demo_space"
    class='foo
           padding-1em-2em
           margin-1em
           color-#333'>  <!-- That's it. Polyclass classes are ready-to-use. -->

    <p>Styled content from <strong>only</strong> CSS classes.</p>
</div>
```

#### What's Created

The styles are automatically generated:

| class | description |
| --- | --- |
| `padding-1em-2em` | Padding, top and bottom `1em`, left and right `2em` |
| `margin-1em` | Margin, all sides `1em` |
| `color-#333`| Text color, nearly black `#333` |


Here's the CSS Polyclass created:

```css
.padding-1em-2em {
    padding: 1em 2em;
}

.margin-1em {
    margin: 1em;
}

.color-\#333 {
    color: #333;
}
```

## Who is this for?

### Designers

Iterate on your styles until you're happy. With a **massive** base of rules there is less to _build_ as you invent.

### Developers

Don't spend time caring for your _base styles_. Use a declarative naming convention for your class names for easy to document, easy to integrate core styles, and less bytes to download.

### Vendors

Build your layout engine or style library. Enable the _vendor_ prefix and invent your own dynamic classes.

## Why?

+ **Reduce Boilerplate**
  Ideas change. Designs alter. Polyclass can help kill the junk CSS and massive boiler-sheets of _pre defined classes_.
+ **Become your own vendor!**
  Don't settle for a _forever_ locked-in eco-system, supporting enormous stylesheets. Build out your own boilerplate, add a vendor switch and job done!
+ **Generate _Dynamic Classes_**
  Build dynamic names to write base and generate layouts without limits, such as a column-structure: `acme-grid-columms-4`,  `acme-grid-columms-3`, `acme-grid-columms-12`
+ **Faster page load times**
  CSS mean bytes down the pipe. Polyclass builds CSS on the fly.
+ **Dynamic CSS tooling**
  With _ALL CSS_ Properties ready to go, you can offer this tool in your buildouts; for dynamic styling of your components - without base sheets and limits.
  + CMS theming addons
  + HTML edit only environments
  + extend to make your own dynamic sheet inclusions.


### What is "Just-in-Time"?

> Polyclass does not have a pre-compiled list of CSS Classes. Definitions are generated through a process of detected _used_ classes, and immediately creating a corresponding CSS declaration.

Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation in Polyclass dynamically generates CSS classes as they're needed, optimizing efficiency by focusing only on the styles actively used in the document. This process ensures lean performance-oriented styling, eliminating pre-compiled CSS clutter and enhancing web application responsiveness.

```jinja
<div class='margin-5em-20vw'>
    <p>This div immediately generates the class</p>
</div>

<div class='margin-5em-20vw'>
    <p>This div reuses the previously generated class</p>
</div>
```

### What is "Declarative" CSS?


In its simplified form the term "declarative" means _what to do_, where the antonym "imperative" would be _how to do_:

| Declarative | Imperative |
| --- | --- |
| What to do | How to do |
| Expression | Statement |
| Less Variable Mutation | More Variable Mutation |

HTML is declarative, allowing the developer to perceive an object as the literal entity. For example we have a layout including a single header `h1`. The identity of the object is _"what is does"_. A `h1` will never be a `input`.

```jinja
<body>
  <div>
    <h1>This is a H1</h1>
  </div>
</body>
```

#### Declarative CSS with Polyclass

By naming a class to mirror CSS properties and their values, such as `border-color-red`, users explicitly define _what to do_ without delving into how to achieve it. This approach removes the verbosity and complexity traditionally associated with CSS, streamlining style application and changes.

| Declarative Class Name | CSS Output             |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| `margin-1em`           | `margin: 1em;`         |
| `border-color-red`     | `border-color: red;`   |
| `text-align-center`    | `text-align: center;`  |


Declarative CSS with Polyclass means direct, readable, and maintainable code, where style modifications are as simple as swapping class names, ensuring a seamless and intuitive design experience.


#### Developer Speed

A declarative method for CSS styles ensure:

+ Developers **know** how a class affects the view
  As the **class-name _is_ the declaration**, is extremely unlikely to find `color-red` representing another colour.
+ Immediate Learning
  Existing developer knowledge is an advantage, with a base library using **real hex, `hsl` or even `Q` measurements** for values.
+ Instant Integration
  Using a clean naming convention allows the developer to instantly update the view to reflect changes with no cleanup of old classes is required.

Polyclass's JIT approach exemplifies how on-demand generation of styles can streamline development workflows, offering a flexible, efficient solution for real-time CSS management.


```jinja
<div class='display-flex
            max-width-80vw
            font-size-1.222ch
            padding-0-10vw'>

        <h1 class='font-size-5rem'>
          Instant styling,
          Immediately generated,
          Never stale.
        </h1>
</div>
```


## Example

If there is a CSS Property, it can be defined in Polyclass. Here's some HTML, with some `Polyclass` CSS `class` attributes:

```jinja
<div class="my-container some-other-primary-area
    font-pack-roboto-100-400-i400
    background-#333"> <!-- Load fonts, and a background-color -->

      <div class="demo-box
        gap-1em
        display-flex
        flex-direction-column
        "> <!-- convert to the flex box model, with a gap -->

          <div class="my-text-thing
            background-color-#111
            border-solid-3px-green
            border-radius-.4em
            padding-.8em-1.4em
            color-#EEE
            font-roboto-400
            margin-1em"> <!-- A rounded border, background, color, and font changes -->

              Text content.

          </div>
      </div>
</div>
```

Once defined, the constructed classes are invented on-the-fly:

| class | property | values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| background-color-#111 |  background-color |  #111 |
| background-#333 |  background |  #333 |
| border-solid-3px-green |  border |  3px green |
| border-radius-.4em |  border |  0.4em |
| color-#EEE |  color |  #EEE |
| display-flex |  display |  flex |
| flex-direction-column |  flex |  column |
| gap-1em |  gap |  gap-1em |
| margin-1em |  margin |  1em |
| padding-.8em-1.4em |  padding | 0.8em 1.4em |
| font-pack-roboto-100-400-i400 | *\*Special case* |  Install font "Roboto", 100, 400, italic 400 |
| font-roboto-400 |  font-family, font-size |  "Roboto", 400 |

As expected each class exactly represents the `key:value` of any _declarable_ CSS Property.

---

Without using any existing CSS sheets, Polyclass will generate all the expected CSS as a constructed stylesheet.
