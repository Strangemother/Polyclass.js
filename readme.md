```

Polyclass is a _just-in-time_ CSS class library, built dynamically from your class-names using "Declarative CSS".

> All the boilerplate CSS is builtin with Polyclass.js


This open-source, lightweight library is tailored for dynamic CSS management, generating a graph of keys for all CSS properties. With the capability to boilerplate millions of unique class combinations through declarative naming, Polyclass offers eliminating the need for in-line styles. Whether you're working with pre-rendered content or making live DOM changes, Polyclass ensures the stylesheet is declared as needed.

+ Readable
+ Instantly plug-and-play
+ No Dependencies, and works along-side all the major libraries.
+ Real-time: Seamless compatibility with both pre-rendered content and live DOM changes.

## ðŸš€ In a Hurry?

Include:

```jinja
<script src="polyclass.js"></script>
```

Polyclass automatic:

```jinja
<body polyclass> <!-- Activate -->
  <h1
    class='color-#999'> <!-- Write classes -->
    Grey Title!</h1>
</body>
```

**Polyclass anything!**

```jinja
<div class="my-container some-other-primary-area
    font-pack-roboto-100-400-i400
    background-#333">

      <div class="demo-box
        gap-1em
        display-flex
        flex-direction-column">

          <div class="text
            background-color-#111
            border-solid-3px-green
            border-radius-.4em
            padding-.8em-1.4em
            color-#EEE
            font-roboto-400
            margin-1em">

              Text content.
          </div>
      </div>
</div>
```

## Bits and Bolts:

+ [Run](./running-polyclass.md)
+ [`font-pack-*` addon](./font-pack.md): Install and use fonts dynamically with `font-pack-*`
+ [CSS `var()`](./css-var.md): Utilise variables for declarative properties and values `color-var-primary-text`
+ [Polyclass `vars()` object](./vars-object.md): Use Javascript objects as CSS `--var` definitions.
+ [`vendor-*` prefix](./vendor-prefix.md): Scope Polyclass usage to a prefix such as `acme-company-background-black`
+ [Aliases](./aliases.md): Reduce typing by aliasing long words `background` => `bg` == `bg-color-*`
+ [Inserting Rules](./inserting-rules.md): Inject CSS declarations and custom class detection functions.
+ [Polyclass and CSS Anatomy](./anatomy.md): Understand a CSS Property
+ [Addons](./addons.md): Read more on the addon platform for customising Polyclass internals


## Usage

### Install

Include Polyclass as a script:

```jinja
<script src="polyclass.js"></script>
```

### Load

#### HTML `polyclass` attribute

Use the Polyclass automatic detection:

```jinja
<body polyclass>
  <h1 class='color-#999'>Grey Title!</h1>
</body>
```

#### JavaScipt `Polyclass` Instance

Run `Polyclass` somewhere in your code. It can run in the `<head>`, the `<footer>`, or installed asynchronously.

```js
const pc = Polyclass({
  processOnLoad: document.body
})
```

If the page is already loaded, run the `process()` method:

```js
const pc = Polyclass()
pc.process(document.body)
```

#### Use

And you're ready to go! Populate the html classes to see it in action:

```jinja
<div id="demo_space"
    class='foo
           padding-1em-2em
           margin-1em
           color-#333'>  <!-- That's it. Polyclass classes are ready-to-use. -->

    <p>Styled content from <strong>only</strong> CSS classes.</p>
</div>
```

#### What's Created

The styles are automatically generated:

| class | description |
| --- | --- |
| `padding-1em-2em` | Padding, top and bottom `1em`, left and right `2em` |
| `margin-1em` | Margin, all sides `1em` |
| `color-#333`| Text color, nearly black `#333` |


Here's the CSS Polyclass created:

```css
.padding-1em-2em {
    padding: 1em 2em;
}

.margin-1em {
    margin: 1em;
}

.color-#333 {
    color: #333;
}
```

## Who is this for?

### Designers

Iterate on your styles until you're happy. With a **massive** base of rules there is less to _build_ as you invent.

### Developers

Don't spend time caring for your _base styles_. Use a declarative naming convension for your class names for easy to document, easy to integrate core styles, and less bytes to download.

### Vendors

Build your layout engine or style library. Enable the _vendor_ prefix and invent your own dynamic classes.


## Why?

+ **Reduce Boilerplate**
  Ideas change. Designs alter. Polyclass can help kill the junk CSS and massive boiler-sheets of _pre defined classes_.
+ **Become your own vendor!**
  Don't settle for a _forever_ locked-in eco-system, supporting enourmous stylesheets. Build out your own boilerplate, add a vendor switch and job done!
+ **Generate _Dynamic Classes_**
  Build dyanamic names to write base and generate layouts without limits, such as a column-stucture: `acme-grid-columms-4`,  `acme-grid-columms-3`, `acme-grid-columms-12`
+ **Faster page load times**
  CSS mean bytes down the pipe. Polyclass builds CSS on the fly.
+ **Dynamic CSS tooling**
  With _ALL CSS_ Properties ready to go, you can offer this tool in your buildouts; for dynamic styling of your components - without base sheets and limits.
  + CMS theming addons
  + HTML edit only environments
  + extend to make your own dynamic sheet inclusions.

## Example

If there is a CSS Property, it can be defined in Polyclass. Here's some HTML, with some `Polyclass` CSS `class` attributes:

```jinja
<div class="my-container some-other-primary-area
    font-pack-roboto-100-400-i400
    background-#333">

      <div class="demo-box
        gap-1em
        display-flex
        flex-direction-column
        ">

          <div class="text
            background-color-#111
            border-solid-3px-green
            border-radius-.4em
            padding-.8em-1.4em
            color-#EEE
            font-roboto-400
            margin-1em">

              Text content.

          </div>
      </div>
</div>
```

Once defined, the constructed classes are invented on-the-fly:

| class | property | values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| background-color-#111 |  background-color |  #111 |
| background-#333 |  background |  #333 |
| border-solid-3px-green |  border |  3px green |
| border-radius-.4em |  border |  0.4em |
| color-#EEE |  color |  #EEE |
| display-flex |  display |  flex |
| flex-direction-column |  flex |  column |
| gap-1em |  gap |  gap-1em |
| margin-1em |  margin |  1em |
| padding-.8em-1.4em |  padding | 0.8em 1.4em |
| font-pack-roboto-100-400-i400 | *\*Special case* |  Install font "Roboto", 100, 400, italic 400 |
| font-roboto-400 |  font-family, font-size |  "Roboto", 400 |

As expected each class exactly represents the `key:value` of any _declarable_ CSS Property.

---

Without using any existing CSS sheets, Polyclass will generate all the expected CSS as a constructed stylesheet.
